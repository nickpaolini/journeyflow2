Step Type Guidelines - Choose the most appropriate type based on the INTENT and NATURE of the step:

- "action": Customer performs an action or task (e.g., clicking buttons, filling forms, making purchases, navigating pages) [‚ö° #10b981]
- "decision": Customer makes a choice that impacts journey path (e.g., selecting plan options, choosing payment method, deciding to continue or abandon) [‚ùì #f59e0b]
- "wait": Waiting period or delay in the process (e.g., waiting for approval, processing time) [‚è±Ô∏è #6b7280]
- "email": Email communication sent or received (e.g., confirmation, notification) [üìß #3b82f6]
- "sms": SMS/text message sent or received (e.g., verification code, alert) [üì± #8b5cf6]
- "webhook": Automated system-to-system notification or integration (e.g., webhook trigger, API call) [üîó #ef4444]
- "feedback": Customer expresses feelings, ratings, or reviews (e.g., leaving reviews, rating experiences, providing testimonials, complaining) [üí¨ #FFD700]
- "discovery": Customer discovers or learns about something new (e.g., product discovery, feature exploration) [üîç #00BFFF]
- "support": Customer service or self-service interactions (e.g., contacting helpdesk, using live chat, accessing FAQ, getting assistance) [üÜò #06b6d4]
- "milestone": Significant achievements or desired outcomes (e.g., completing onboarding, reaching goals, account activation, successful purchase) [üèÅ #84cc16]
- "internal": Backend or internal process that influences customer experience (e.g., order processing, account verification, payment processing, inventory checks) [‚öôÔ∏è #64748b]

Color Mapping (use exact HEX codes):
- action: #10b981 (emerald green)
- decision: #f59e0b (amber)
- wait: #6b7280 (gray)
- email: #3b82f6 (blue)
- sms: #8b5cf6 (purple)

Guidelines:
- Each step title should be 2-4 words maximum
- Each step description should be 1-2 sentences maximum (approximately 50-80 characters)
- Focus on the INTENT and NATURE of the step, not just keywords
- Consider the customer's perspective and what they're trying to accomplish
- Use clear, actionable language
- Avoid lengthy explanations - be concise and direct
- Categorize each step into the most appropriate type from the list above
- Always include both stepType and stepColor for each step
- Always include the details object for each step, even if some fields are empty
- Connections are optional - if not provided, steps will be connected sequentially
- If a suitable journey cannot be generated from the prompt, return an empty steps array.
